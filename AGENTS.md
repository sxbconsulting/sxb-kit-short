# sxb-kit-short — the map (Claude Code and Codex)

One video = one folder cloned from this kit. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so both agents read the same map.
**The playbook is Nate Herk's `short-form-edit` skill, kept verbatim in `.claude/skills/`** (Codex mirror: `.agents/skills/`).
This file does not rewrite it. For each of Nate's steps it names the local tool that does the work and the gate where the
user says "ok". When in doubt, Nate's skill wins; this file only says how we run it here.

The user validates at every gate. Nothing is built before the "ok" on the current gate. That is the whole method.

## First run: setup

If `./setup.sh` has never been run on this machine, run it first and read its output. It names each missing tool with the
command to install it. If no transcription engine is set up, walk the user through it in plain words: option A, an
ElevenLabs key (they create it at https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys and put it themselves in a `.env` file in
the project, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=…`, or in their shell profile; **never ask them to paste the key into the chat**, and if a
key appears in the chat, tell them to revoke it); option B, `./setup.sh --whisperx` for a free local engine. Then run
`./setup.sh` again.

## Read in this order

1. `RUN.md` of the project: state, gates ticked, decisions.
2. `.claude/skills/short-form-edit/SKILL.md` (the playbook) and its references: `quality-gates.md`, `plan-schema.md`,
   `curiosity-and-entertainment.md`, `reference-analysis.md`, `premium-motion-and-footage.md`.
3. `DESIGN.md` (the kit's default paper look) and `MOTION.md` (motion rules and verification). A brand brief supplied by the
   user (tokens from a site capture, a logo, fonts) replaces the kit's look for that project.
4. `hyperframes-core` before writing any composition; `hyperframes-video-beats` and `video-storytelling` to plan beats.

## The seven gates

| # | Gate | Nate's step (short-form-edit) | Tool here | The user validates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Framing** | Probe source and reference | Rush copied, never moved. `ffprobe` (format, rotation, pix_fmt). 16:9 rush → three vertical crops proposed on three moments. `takes.py` converts HEVC / 10-bit to H.264 `yuv420p` itself. | the crop |
| 2 | **Rough cut** | Silence + mistake tools, manual transcript review, render the clean cut once | `python3 scripts/takes.py <rush>` → `assets/derush/`: measured silence threshold, cut points on the waveform, transcription (ElevenLabs Scribe, words grouped per take, numbers as digits; WhisperX locally if no key), retakes and false starts detected, decision list printed; on a quiet or noisy track that yields one long take it splits on the word gaps of a whole-file Scribe transcript instead. Every clip is tone-mapped to SDR bt709 on the way in (`scripts/sdr.py`): an HDR source would switch HyperFrames to its HDR pipeline, which ghosts hidden layers. Then `python3 scripts/stage.py`: trim + concat → `assets/speaker.mp4`, `assets/reel-audio.wav`, `assets/transcript.json`, `assets/edit-decisions.json`. | the take list, then the cut-only video |
| 3 | **Captions** | Captions | Ask the user first: default look (`pop`, white, keywords enlarged, no color), `pop` with an accent color (`caption_accent`), `kit` or `nate`, or the captions of their reference reel (look at its frames, then match words per caption, font, color, position). One-scene `storyboard.json` (layout `F`) → `build-reel.py` → draft render. | caption style, spelling of names (`lexicon`) |
| 4 | **Beats and assets** | Reference analysis, asset shortlist, DESIGN.md, beat plan, OPEN-LOOPS | `REFERENCE-ANALYSIS.md` (timecode / idea / visual / sound / question / payoff), `DESIGN.md` of the project (audience, direction, shortlist, three opening concepts, sequences), `OPEN-LOOPS.json`, the beats table in chat, one line per beat, bare moments included. **Footage**: real screenshots first (`npx hyperframes capture <URL>` → `assets/captures/<slug>/`, brand tokens in `extracted/`), the user's own asset bank, then clips the user points to or the agent finds: `python3 scripts/footage.py <url-or-file> --slug x --from 12 --to 18 --why "…" --rights "…"` → `assets/broll/x.mp4` + `assets/broll/ledger.json` (build-reel.py then writes `assets/footage-ledger.json` for the clips actually used). Every asset has a provenance and a usable interval. No invented mockup when the real thing exists, no generated footage unless the user asks. | the beats table line by line, each B-roll with its reason and its rights |
| 5 | **Opening** | Three rough openings, compare the first 3 s | Three first frames (HTML + headless Chrome, or three storyboards) side by side. Choice and reason written in `DESIGN.md`. | A / B / C |
| 6 | **Animatic → final** | Animatic before polish, build the visual world, layers and actions, music, lint / preview / draft / final | Full `storyboard.json` → `python3 scripts/build-reel.py` → `compositions/`, `index.html`, captions, `assets/plan.json`. `npm run check` at 0, `node .claude/skills/short-form-edit/scripts/validate-plan.mjs .`, `validate-footage.mjs .` when B-roll is used, draft render → the user's feedback in sentences → v2, v3. Then Studio (`npm run dev`, give the exact URL printed) and `npm run render`. Three correction rounds max. Music and SFX (`media-use`, `hyperframes-audio`, 14–20 dB under the voice, −16 LUFS) only if the user wants them. | each animatic, the Studio pass, the final render |
| 7 | **Delivery** | Delivery, VERIFY | `VERIFY.md` (hash, what was actually checked), `ENTERTAINMENT-REVIEW.md`. Final file in `renders/`, caption proposed in chat, see below. | the final file, the caption, the keyword |

### Gate 7: delivery

The kit does not publish. The agent hands over, then the user posts by hand on the platforms they choose:

1. The final render path (`renders/<slug>.mp4`), its duration, resolution and SHA-256 hash, as written in `VERIFY.md`.
2. A caption proposal (hook line, body, hashtags) and, if the reel ends on "comment KEYWORD", the keyword and the DM text
   the user will set up in their own tool.
3. Optionally a cover frame (`npm run snapshot -- --at <s>`) for the platforms that ask for one.

The agent never uploads the video anywhere and never connects to a social account.

```

Layouts: **F** full-frame face, optional `overlay` (text, image, chevrons) or CTA card `keyword` · **S** Nate's split: a screen
zone on top (0→880 px, brand colors) and the face below; `zone.items` of type `card`, `badge`, `stamp`, `image`, `video`,
`big`, `check`, `logo`, `photo`, `chevrons`, `line`; `zone.full` + `in` = a full-frame end screen that curtains down over the
face · **C / B / D**: the paper look of `DESIGN.md` (face top + paper bottom, paper top + face box, full paper) ·
**Y** (16:9, needs `"format": "youtube"` at the top of the storyboard, 1920×1080): a full-frame world with the speaker as a
**card that moves** inside it, in the shape of a YouTube intro where every sentence triggers what it describes.
`"bg"`: `"mesh"` (a soft gradient built from the brand accent, slowly drifting) or a path to an image.
`"face"`: `[{"pos": "left", "at": "w:mot"}, {"pos": "tl", "at": 11.3}, {"pos": "full", "at": 18}]` with `full`, `wide`,
`left`, `right`, `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br`, `center`, `hidden`; the card is cut out of the 16:9 source with `clip-path`, so a
portrait card never distorts the picture. `face_crop_y` `[x, y]` (0 to 1) frames the subject inside the card and
`face_zoom_y` (1.22 by default) tightens it. `zone.items` adds to the S list: `glass` (frosted card, `icon`, `title`,
`number`/`count`, `sub`, `bars`, `shot`, `dark`), `statement` (`kicker` + big `text` with `<em>` + `sub`), `pill` (glass
button, `arrow`), `tag` (small rounded label), `cascade` (`src` list of clips fanned out in 3D, `cw`, `ch`, `step`, `tilt`,
`rise`). `caption_style: "nate"` puts the captions on a dark pill with each keyword in an accent box.
Every timed value accepts a word anchor: `"at": "w:word"` = the start of that word in the transcript. Scenes must start on a
word (Nate's validator wants an anchor within −0.15 / +0.2 s); a scene with no visual event for more than 2.2 s carries a
`holdReason`. `caption_style`: `pop` by default (Helvetica Neue Bold, word-by-word reveal, keyword ×1.55 in the caption color;
`caption_accent` colors the keywords), `kit` (pill, uppercase) or `nate`. `lexicon` fixes one word → one word (proper nouns). `keywords` are matched ignoring case, punctuation
and elisions ("d'ingénieur" matches "ingénieur", "40 825" matches "40 825"). `locale` (default `en-US`) formats the numbers in
count-ups and sets the HTML `lang`; `lang` overrides the latter. Transcription detects the language on its own
(`transcribe.py --lang xx` forces it); only French spelled-out numbers are converted to digits.

```

## Hard rules

Nothing is built before the user's "ok" on the current gate. Real screenshots over invented mockups. Nothing on the face, no
cutout, no matting. Media never in git. Exact spelling of proper nouns through `lexicon`. Never edit a generated file. Footage
has a provenance and rights before it enters a beat. No secret on screen: API keys live in the environment, never in a
file, a command line or a message. Nothing is uploaded or published by the agent.

## HyperFrames contract, reminder

Root `div` with `id`, `data-composition-id`, `data-start="0"`, `data-duration`, `data-width`, `data-height`. Every timed element:
`data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-track-index`, `class="clip"`; the track is only time, the visual order is z-index. One paused
GSAP timeline per composition on `window.__timelines["<id>"]`. Sub-composition: everything inside `<template>`, root `#root`,
host id = inner id. Strict determinism. See `MOTION.md`.
