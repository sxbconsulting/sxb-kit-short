# SB kit short

Edit a talking-head reel with an AI agent (Claude Code or Codex), from the rush to the final render.
The agent does the work; you say "ok" at seven gates. Rendering is HyperFrames (HTML → video), the playbook is
Nate Herk's `short-form-edit` skill kept verbatim. Publication stays in your hands: the agent hands you the final file
and the caption, you post it on the platforms yourself.

```
rush.mov ──► 1 framing ──► 2 rough cut ──► 3 captions ──► 4 beats + assets ──► 5 opening ──► 6 animatic → final ──► 7 delivery
```

## Start here

Four steps, about ten minutes the first time. You never write code.

**1. Get the kit.** Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sxbconsulting/sxb-kit-short ~/sxb-kit-short && cd ~/sxb-kit-short && ./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` checks Node 20+, ffmpeg, Python 3.10+ and numpy, and prints the install command for whatever is missing.
No terminal? Open Claude Code or Codex in any folder and paste this instead:

> Clone https://github.com/sxbconsulting/sxb-kit-short into ~/sxb-kit-short, run ./setup.sh, and walk me through whatever is missing.

**2. Add a transcription key.** In the kit folder:

```bash
./setup.sh --key
```

It asks for your [ElevenLabs key](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys) and nothing shows on screen while you paste.
The key lands in a git-ignored `.env`. About 0.22 $ per hour of audio, so a cent per reel, and it keeps every retake.
No account? `./setup.sh --whisperx` installs a free local engine instead, slower, about 2 GB of models.

**3. Start a video.** Copy the kit into a new folder, one folder per video, and open your agent there:

```bash
cp -R ~/sxb-kit-short ~/videos/my-first-reel && cd ~/videos/my-first-reel
claude        # or: codex
```

**4. Hand it your rush** and paste a prompt like this one:

> Edit this rush into a 9:16 reel following AGENTS.md, gate by gate, and stop at each gate for my ok.
> Reference reel: <file or URL>. Brand: <site URL or logo>. CTA: comment "KEYWORD". Rush: <path to your file>

The agent reads `AGENTS.md`, cuts the rush and comes back with the list of takes it kept and dropped. That is gate 2,
and you answer in plain sentences, like you would to an editor. Six gates later the reel is rendered, verified, and handed to you with its caption, ready to post.

The same kit edits a 16:9 YouTube video (`"format": "youtube"` in `storyboard.json`, layout `Y`): the speaker moves to a
corner on a word, clips play in tilted phone frames, cards and numbers pop where the sentence says so.

Any language Scribe or WhisperX understands works, detected automatically. In French, spelled-out numbers become digits
on screen. `"locale"` in `storyboard.json` sets number formatting (`en-US` by default).

## What is inside

- `AGENTS.md` (= `CLAUDE.md`): the map, one line per gate: Nate's step, the local tool, what you validate.
- `DESIGN.md`: the default paper look. `MOTION.md`: motion rules and how the agent verifies its work.
- `scripts/`: `takes.py` (rough cut per take, retakes detected), `transcribe.py` (Scribe or WhisperX, numbers as digits),
  `stage.py` (cut → assets in Nate's schema), `footage.py` (B-roll with provenance), `build-reel.py`
  (storyboard.json → HyperFrames compositions, captions, plan.json), plus Nate's validators.
- `.claude/skills/`: HyperFrames 0.8.42 skills + Nate's `short-form-edit`, `video-storytelling`, `hyperframes-video-beats`.
  `.agents/skills/` is the same set for Codex.
- `assets/fonts/` (Archivo, Fraunces, Caveat, OFL), `references/` (Nate's motion philosophy and storytelling workbook).

Media never lives in git. See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` for what comes from where.
